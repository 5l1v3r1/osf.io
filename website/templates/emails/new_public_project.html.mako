OSF features:

You can enable other OSF users to comment [link to settings] on your work.
Visitors to your project can cite your work using the citation widget on your project’s page [link to overview]

[Tweet your Project] -- a "tweet your project" button with pre-formatted tweet linking to their work

If you would like to learn more about how to take advantage of any of these features, visit our Getting Started [https://osf.io/getting-started/#start] page or drop us a line [mailto:support@osf.io].
