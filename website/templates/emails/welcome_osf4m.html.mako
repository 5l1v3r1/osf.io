Hello [first name, last name],
Thanks for adding your <presentation or poster> from <Conference Name> to the conference’s Open Science Framework http://osf.io (OSF) page! Sharing virtually is an easy way to increase the impact of your research. Your project has already been viewed XX times!
Have you considered adding your manuscript, data, or other research materials to the project? Adding these materials means:
When someone finds your poster or talk, they can see and cite the accompanying data
You have one place to reference when looking for your research materials
You can monitor interest in your data and materials by tracking downloads, just like you can for your <Conference Name> <presentation or poster>.

To learn more about how the OSF can help you manage your research, begin with these (short!) videos on our Getting Started http://osf.io/getting-started page. Or, read about how others use the OSF from a case study https://osf.io/7a8gs/.
The best part? It’s all free! OSF is supported by the non-profit technology company, the Center for Open Science http://cos.io/.
Best wishes,
COS Support Team
P.S. Got questions? Just send an email support@osf.io!
