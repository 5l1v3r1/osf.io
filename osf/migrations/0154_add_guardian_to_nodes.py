NODE MIGRATION
1) Creates three django groups for each existing abstract node (admin/write/read)
2) Gives admin groups admin/write/read perms, write groups write/read, and read: read
 - Populates osf NodeGroupObjectPermission (DFK) table instead of out-of-the-box guardian GroupObjectPermission table
3) Adds node contributors to corresponding django groups - a node write contributor is added to the node's write django group
 - Populates OSFUserGroups table with group id/user id pair

PREPRINT MIGRATION (were already using guardian, but weren't using direct foreign keys)
1) For each guardian GroupObjectPermission table entry that is related to a preprint, add entry to the
PreprintGroupObjectPermission table
